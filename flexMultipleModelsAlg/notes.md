## Flex Model Notes

### Process
1. Create individual models
    a. o/u 10 ppg
    b. o/u 12 ppg
    c. o/u 14 ppg
    d. o/u 16 ppg
    e. o/u 18 ppg
    f. o/u 20 ppg
    - These can be adjusted later
    - Binary or probability?
2. Use individual models to predict overall tier
    - Which is the highest tier we predict the model to be in?
3. Test accuracy at the end
